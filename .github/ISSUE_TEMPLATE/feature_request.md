**Describe the feature you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Has it already been considered?**
Check if this is a duplicate, unless you have a good way to implement something that was rejected.

**Does it fit CodeClient**
CodeClient is for enhanced coding, so features outside of coding will be rare.
This also means nothing outside of df which isn't df related.
CodeClient also avoids implementing features from other mods, such as [recode](https://github.com/homchom/recode).
- [ ] Does it not affect gameplay, or anything outside DiamondFire?
- [ ] Is it not in recode?
